## Gif files Documentation
This repository contains gifs for modeled CAPE, updraft and precipitation during storm evolutions, using the Convection-Permitting Model output acquired from NCAR Research Data Archive. Please find Liu et al. (2020) for more details of the model. 

The gifs includes: 
1) tracked_storms_20020602.gif, corresponding to Figure 2 on the poster, which shows how the storm tracking algorithm treats the storms as they evolve in time. t = 0 corresponds to June 2nd 00 UTC, 2002, and the time step is 3 hours. 
2) entire_domain_20010615_20010619.gif, which shows the entire simulation domain of North America, from June 15th to June 19th, 2001. 
3) heavy_precipitation_20010805_20010809.gif, corresponding to Figure 4 of the poster, which shows a zoomed-in view of the most intense precipitation event across year 2001. The event is centered at 95.8W, 22.6N, over the warm ocean surface of the Gulf of Mexico. 

Please find a pdf version of the poster linked here.

## Gif files Documentation
This repository contains gifs for modeled CAPE, updraft and precipitation during storm evolutions, using the Convection-Permitting Model output acquired from NCAR Research Data Archive. Please find Liu et al. (2020) for more details of the model. 

The gifs includes: 
1) tracked_storms_20020602.gif, corresponding to Figure 2 on the poster, which shows how the storm tracking algorithm treats the storms as they evolve in time
2) entire_domain_20010615_20010619.gif,
